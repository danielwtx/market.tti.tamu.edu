The Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute (TTI) has, over the past six months and as a part of a contract between the Transportation Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, developed a series of Excel-based models to provide high-level estimates of the relative benefit to the agriculture sector of roadway infrastructure projects. This work will now be transitioned from an Excel-based file to web-based application to provide much greater ease of use for end-users in the agricultural industry. TTI will host the web-based model on a TTI server and provide routine maintenance to insure the model remains in good working order.
